### GEC FOSS Community presents Road to Godot Elite

<br>

Be it massive AAA games like COD or Far Cry, gorgeous indies like Celeste, arcade classics like Pacman or many of the wallet defeulers so abundant on the playstore - we've all enjoyed a good video game. They provide immersive and interactive narrative experiences like no other medium.

<br>

Many have wondered about what goes into making such a product. Well here we are to turn that spark into a flame. Our very own Julius Alphonso will take you on a tour of the Godot engine. Teaching just how everything in a game is made as he live streams the development of an arcade classic - Pacman.

<br>

We'll be covering concepts involved in game development, use of the FOSS game engine - Godot, entity movements, scoring systems and even the AI used by the ghosts.

All you need is Godot, familiarity with vector maths, and some media resources.

<br>

Best part? It's FREE and Open to all.
