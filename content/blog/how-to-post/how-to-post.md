# How to get started with blog posts

We'll follow the following structure to ensure things stay organized.

<br>

## Folder Structure

![Random image](./folder-structure.jpeg)

1. Create a folder inside content/blog
1. Use kebab case to name the folder, the same name will be used for your file. For example, in the above picture, I name my file and folder as 'how-to-post'.
1. Create a markdown file with the same name as your folder.
1. Add any images that you will require to the folder or directly use their links.
